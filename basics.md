# 📜 History & Origin of JavaScript

- Created by: `Brendan Eich`
- Year: 1995
- Company: `Netscape`
- Original Name: `Mocha` → `LiveScript` → `JavaScript`
- Developed in just 10 days for the Netscape browser.

> 👉 Later standardized by `ECMA International` as `ECMAScript (ES)`.

# 🚀 Major JavaScript Versions

- `ES1` (1997) – First standard
- `ES3` (1999) – Widely supported
- `ES5` (2009) – strict mode, JSON support
- `ES6 / ES2015` – Biggest update -- let, const, Arrow functions ()=>{}, Classes, Modules, Promises
- `ES7–ES13` (2016–2022) – Smaller yearly updates -- async/await, Optional chaining ?., Nullish coalescing ??

# Properties of Javascript

## 1️⃣ High-Level Language
- A high-level language is easy for humans to read and write.
- In JavaScript:
  - You don’t manage memory manually.
  - You don’t deal with hardware directly.
  - The engine handles low-level operations for you.

## 2️⃣ Interpreted Language
- An interpreted language runs code line by line using an engine.
- JavaScript is executed by engines like:
  - Chrome → `V8 engine`
  - Firefox → `SpiderMonkey`
- Unlike compiled languages (like C++), JS doesn’t need a separate compilation step before running.
- ⚠️ Modern JS engines actually compile internally using `JIT (Just-In-Time compilation)`, but for understanding basics, we call it interpreted.

## 3️⃣ Dynamically Typed
- In dynamically typed languages, you don’t declare data types explicitly.
- The type is decided at runtime.

## 4️⃣ Single-Threaded
- JavaScript runs on one main thread.
- It executes:
  - One task at a time
  - In a single `call stack`
- But then how does it handle multiple tasks?
  - 👉 With `Event Loop` & `asynchronous behavior`.

## 5️⃣ Event-Driven
- JavaScript reacts to events.
- Events can be: Button clicks, Mouse movement, API responses, Timers
- JS waits for the event and runs code only when it happens. That’s why it’s called `event-driven programming`.
- Example:
```
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Clicked!");
});
```

## 6️⃣ Prototype-Based Language
- JavaScript does not use traditional class-based inheritance (like Java).
- Instead, it uses prototypes.
- Every object in JS has a hidden property called: [[Prototype]]
- Objects can inherit properties from other objects.
- Example:
```
let person = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};

let student = Object.create(person);
student.greet();  
```
- Here:
- student inherits from person
- This is prototype-based inheritance

> (ES6 introduced class, but internally it still uses prototypes.)

## document.body.innerHTML('')
- it gets or sets the entire HTML content inside the <body> tag of the webpage.
**1. When you READ it**
```
console.log(document.body.innerHTML);
``` 
**2. When you WRITE to it**
```
document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>Hi Tanya</h1>";
```
- 👉 It replaces everything inside <body> with the new HTML.

### ⚠️ Important Things
- It removes all existing elements and event listeners inside body.
- It completely rewrites the DOM inside <body>.
- Not recommended for large apps (like React), but okay for small demos.
